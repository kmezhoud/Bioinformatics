## Cas d'étude: Identification Graohique de sous-réseaux de gènes associés aux cancers basé sur des données protéomiques réduites

This tutorial describes the main steps used to construct an enriched network from a list of genes with their expression values. The network includes the fold change, the False discovery rate (FDR), the gene expression correlation, the most often involved biological processes, and the most likely corresponding diseases. All the main steps are illustrated by screen shots. The “Tools & Data” section lists all the tools and data required. The “Data computing” section shows you how to compute the data. The Experimental procedure section lists briefly all the steps, and the Walk-through example section illustrates these steps. The final section lists all the software and packages that were tested during this study, but not selected for inclusion in this Note.

### Tools & Data

For this tutorial you will need:



```{r}
library(visNetwork)
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:10,
                    label = paste("Node", 1:10),
                    value = c(10,5,3,7,2,3,2.6,2,9,2),
                    shape ="circle",
                    group= c("Gr1","Gr3"),
                    color= c("#DF0101", "blue")
)

edges <- data.frame(from = c(1,5,3,7,2,9,10,8,3,3,6),
                    to = c(5,3,5,1,5,1,2,3,7,4,9) )



graphe <- visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes, edges, width = "100%")

visNetwork::visOptions(graph= graphe, manipulation = TRUE,
                       selectedBy = "group",
                       highlightNearest = TRUE )

```

<!-- ## Equations -->

<!-- Here is an equation. -->

<!-- \begin{equation}  -->
<!--   f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k} -->
<!--   (\#eq:binom) -->
<!-- \end{equation}  -->

<!-- You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom). -->


<!-- ## Theorems and proofs -->

<!-- Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri). -->

<!-- ::: {.theorem #tri} -->
<!-- For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse -->
<!-- and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have -->
<!-- $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ -->
